# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Set up
With this setup, the frontend calls the backend, the backend fetches data from the SpaceX GraphQL API, and the frontend displays the results. A bit of mobile responsiveness is implemented but still need improvement.

#### For Client 
1. In new terminal go to web folder 
2. run npm i - this will install dev dependencies in local inside node_modules folder
3. run pnpm dev - this will launch application on http://localhost:5173/ (check browser)
